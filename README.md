# ai_reimplementations
(Partial) Reimplementations of AI papers

Currently contains:
- Partial reimplementation of [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07676.pdf], done as a coding assignment for a job interview at a start-up. Functional, done from scratch with the paper used as implementation guidance. Includes PET and iPET training variants, supervised baseines, and knowledge distillation from a model ensemble.

- Implementation of a model used to select the best dialogue continuation from a list of candidates, conditioned on some dialogue context. Can ostensibly serve as a component within a dialogue system.
